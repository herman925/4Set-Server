# Task Validator 404 Fix Summary

## Issue
The `test-pipeline-core-id.html` file was experiencing 404 errors when trying to load task definition files. The errors showed:

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/TEMP/assets/tasks/ERV.json 404 (NOT FOUND)
GET http://127.0.0.1:3000/TEMP/assets/tasks/SYM.json 404 (NOT FOUND)
... (all 15 task files were missing)
```

## Root Cause
The test page is located at `TEMP/test-pipeline-core-id.html` and was loading `task-validator.js` from `../assets/js/task-validator.js`. When the task validator tried to load task files using relative path `assets/tasks/*.json`, it resolved to `TEMP/assets/tasks/*.json` which only contained `survey-structure.json`. The actual task definition files were in the main `assets/tasks/` directory.

## Solution
Following the issue requirement: "I would expect you to use another file instead of the those that are already used by the main core checking system. build these files in the temp folder instead."

We created a test-isolated environment by:

1. **Copying all task definition files to TEMP/assets/tasks/**:
   - ERV.json, SYM.json, NONSYM.json, TheoryofMind.json
   - ChineseWordReading.json, TEC_Female.json, TEC_Male.json
   - MathPattern.json, CCM.json, HeadToeKneeShoulder.json
   - EPN.json, CM.json, FineMotor.json, TGMD.json, MF.json
   - background.json (also copied for completeness)

2. **Creating test-specific task-validator**: `TEMP/task-validator-test.js`
   - Copied from `assets/js/task-validator.js`
   - Uses relative paths suitable for TEMP folder
   - Clearly marked as TEST VERSION in comments

3. **Updating test-pipeline-core-id.html**:
   - Changed script reference from `../assets/js/task-validator.js` to `task-validator-test.js`
   - Updated comment to reflect test-specific approach

4. **Updating documentation**: `TEMP/assets/README.md`
   - Documents test isolation strategy
   - Provides maintenance instructions

## Verification
All 15 task definitions now load successfully:

```
[TaskValidator] Task metadata loaded: 15 tasks
[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: erv {id: erv, title: English Vocab, questionCount: 48}
[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: sym {id: sym, title: Symbolic, questionCount: 59}
[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: nonsym {id: nonsym, title: Non-Symbolic, questionCount: 63}
[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: theoryofmind {id: theoryofmind, title: Theory of Mind, questionCount: 43}
[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: chinesewordreading {id: chinesewordreading, title: Chinese Word Reading, questionCount: 55}

[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: finemotor {id: finemotor, title: Fine Motor, questionCount: 11}
[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: tgmd {id: tgmd, title: TGMD, questionCount: 45}
[TaskValidator] Loaded task definition: mf {id: mf, title: Math Fluency, questionCount: 48}
```

## Benefits
1. **Test Isolation**: Test environment doesn't interfere with production checking system
2. **No 404 Errors**: All task files are local to TEMP folder
3. **Self-Contained**: Test environment is independent and portable
4. **Safe Testing**: Changes to test files don't affect production system

## Maintenance
If task definition files are updated in the main `assets/tasks/` directory, sync them:

```bash
# From repository root
cp assets/tasks/*.json TEMP/assets/tasks/
```

## Files Changed
- `TEMP/test-pipeline-core-id.html` - Updated to use test-specific task-validator
- `TEMP/task-validator-test.js` - New test-specific task validator
- `TEMP/assets/tasks/*.json` - All 16 task definition files copied
- `TEMP/assets/README.md` - Updated documentation
