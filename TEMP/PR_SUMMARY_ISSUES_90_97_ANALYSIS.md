## Critical Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Student Page Missing Essential Scripts ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH SEVERITY

**Problem**: 
The student detail page (`checking_system_4_student.html`) was missing 4 JavaScript modules needed to display merged Qualtrics data:
- `qualtrics-api.js`
- `qualtrics-transformer.js`
- `grade-detector.js`
- `data-merger.js`

**Impact**:
- Student page unable to show merged Qualtrics + JotForm data
- Grade field (K1/K2/K3) would be undefined
- TGMD scoring might fail for new data

**Why It Happened**:
These scripts were added to the home page in PR #92 but the student page was overlooked because it uses a different architecture (`checking-system-student-page.js`).

**Fix**:
Added all 4 missing scripts to `checking_system_4_student.html` in correct dependency order.

**File Changed**: `checking_system_4_student.html`

---

### Bug #2: PRD Documentation Out of Date ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM SEVERITY

**Problem**:
PRD files didn't reflect major changes from PRs #90-#97:
- Complete Qualtrics integration (all tasks, not just TGMD)
- "Earliest non-empty wins" merge strategy
- Grade detection (K1/K2/K3)
- TGMD matrix-radio scoring
- Unique Core ID filtering

**Impact**:
- New developers couldn't understand current system
- Issue #95 remained open
- Documentation drift from implementation

**Fix**:
Comprehensive updates to:
- `PRDs/jotform_qualtrics_integration_prd.md` (~200 lines changed)
- `PRDs/qualtrics_implementation_plan.md` (~150 lines changed)

**Files Changed**: 2 PRD files

## Merge Strategy Changes Explained

The system evolved through 3 stages:

**Stage 1 (PR #92 description)**: 
- Documentation said "Qualtrics overwrites JotForm"

**Stage 2 (PR #94 test pipeline)**:
- Corrected to "earliest non-empty wins"

**Stage 3 (PR #96-#97)**:
- Production code updated to match
- Full timestamp comparison implemented

**Current State**:
- ‚úÖ All code uses "earliest non-empty wins"
- ‚úÖ All documentation updated in this PR
- ‚úÖ Conflict logging with timestamps

---

## Grade Detection Feature

Automatically classifies students as K1/K2/K3 based on assessment date:

**School Year Boundaries** (August to July):
- K1: Aug 2023 - Jul 2024 (school year 2023)
- K2: Aug 2024 - Jul 2025 (school year 2024)
- K3: Aug 2025 - Jul 2026 (school year 2025)

**Data Sources** (in order of preference):
1. `recordedDate` from Qualtrics (ISO 8601 format)
2. `sessionkey` from JotForm (format: `{coreId}_{YYYYMMDD}_{HH}_{MM}`)

**Implementation**:
- `assets/js/grade-detector.js` (production)
- `TEMP/grade-detector-test.js` (UMD test version)
- Integrated into all merged records

---

## TGMD Scoring Feature

Special handling for observational motor skill assessments:

**Trial Aggregation**:
- Each criterion has 2 trials (t1, t2)
- Row score = t1 + t2 (max 2 per criterion)
- Example: TGMD_111_Hop_t1: 1, TGMD_111_Hop_t2: 0 ‚Üí Row score: 1/2

**Task Grouping**:
- 1.ÂñÆËÖ≥Ë∑≥ (Hop): TGMD_111-114
- 2.Á´ãÂÆöË∑≥ÈÅ† (Long Jump): TGMD_211-214
- 3.ÂÅ¥‰ΩµÊ≠• (Slide): TGMD_311-314
- 4.ÈÅãÁêÉ (Dribble): TGMD_411-413
- 5.Êé•ÁêÉ (Catch): TGMD_511-513
- 6.‰ΩéÊâãÊäïÊì≤ (Underhand Throw): TGMD_611-614

**Display**:
- "Success/Fail" labels (not "Correct/Incorrect")
- Trial breakdown shown
- Overall TGMD score calculated

**Implementation**:
- `processTGMDScoring()` in task-validator.js
- `renderTGMDResults()` in checking-system-student-page.js
- CSS styles in checking-system-home.css
