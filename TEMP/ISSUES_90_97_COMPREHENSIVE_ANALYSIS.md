---

### Issue #91: Check what still needs to be done from #90
**Status:** ‚úÖ Closed  
**Files Changed:** 0 files

#### Purpose:
- Meta-issue to track remaining work from #90
- Led to creation of issue #92

#### Findings:
- **No code changes** - purely organizational issue
- Successfully identified that grade detection and Qualtrics integration were incomplete

---

### Issue #92: Complete remaining work from #90
**Status:** ‚úÖ Closed  
**Files Changed:** 5 files

#### What Was Implemented:
1. ‚úÖ Grade detection integration into `data-merger.js`
   - Automatic K1/K2/K3 classification for all merged records
   - Hybrid approach: recordedDate (Qualtrics) ‚Üí sessionkey (JotForm)
2. ‚úÖ Complete Qualtrics data extraction (all 632 fields)
   - Changed from TGMD-only to task-agnostic merge
   - All tasks now merged: ERV, SYM, TOM, CM, CWR, HTKS, TEC, TGMD
3. ‚úÖ Documentation updates to `README.md`
   - Added "Qualtrics Integration & Data Merging" section
   - Explained grade detection logic

#### What Was NOT Implemented:
1. ‚è≥ TGMD matrix-radio scoring (documented in plan, deferred to #93/#94)

#### Issues Found:
- **INCONSISTENCY**: PR description claims "Qualtrics overwrites JotForm" but code uses "earliest non-empty wins"
  - Line 36 of `data-merger.js`: "Earliest non-empty value wins across both sources"
  - This was later corrected in #96/#97

---

### Issue #93: Finish remaining work from #92 (TGMD scoring)
**Status:** ‚úÖ Closed  
**Files Changed:** Unknown (issue only, implementation in #94)

#### Purpose:
- Request to implement TGMD matrix-radio scoring from the plan
- Also requested bug check from #90 changes

#### Findings:
- Led to implementation in issue #94
- No specific bugs identified from #90 changes at this time

---

### Issue #94: Implement TGMD matrix-radio scoring
**Status:** ‚úÖ Closed  
**Files Changed:** 8 files

#### What Was Implemented:
1. ‚úÖ `processTGMDScoring()` in `task-validator.js`
   - Aggregates trial pairs (t1 + t2) into row scores
   - Groups by motor task field (hop, long_jump, etc.)
2. ‚úÖ `renderTGMDResults()` in `checking-system-student-page.js`
   - Grouped display with task headers
   - "Success/Fail" labels instead of "Correct/Incorrect"
   - Trial breakdown display (Trial 1, Trial 2)
3. ‚úÖ CSS styling for trial pills (`.trial-success`, `.trial-fail`)
4. ‚úÖ Documentation updates:
   - `USER_GUIDE_QUALTRICS_TGMD.md` - Clarified all tasks merged
   - `TEMP/TGMD_SCORING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Data workflow
5. ‚úÖ Test pipeline updates in `TEMP/test-pipeline-core-id.html`
   - Corrected merge strategy to "earliest non-empty wins"
   - Added grade separation (K1/K2/K3)

#### Issues Found:
- **DOCUMENTATION CONFLICT**: PR #92 said "Qualtrics overwrites JotForm" but test pipeline in #94 corrected this to "earliest non-empty wins"
- This was later fixed comprehensively in #96/#97

---

### Issue #95: Update PRD documentation
**Status:** üî¥ **STILL OPEN**  
**Files Changed:** None yet

#### What Should Be Updated:
Based on changes in #90-#94, the following PRD files need updates:

1. **`PRDs/jotform_qualtrics_integration_prd.md`**
   - Add complete Qualtrics data extraction (all 632 fields)
   - Add "earliest non-empty wins" merge strategy
   - Add grade detection integration

2. **`PRDs/checking_system_prd.md`**
   - Add TGMD matrix-radio scoring specification
   - Add grade field to data schema
   - Add unique Core ID filtering

3. **`PRDs/qualtrics_implementation_plan.md`**
   - Mark Phase 2 (complete extraction) as COMPLETE
   - Mark Phase 3 (TGMD scoring) as COMPLETE
   - Update remaining work items

4. **`PRDs/data-pipeline.md`**
   - Add grade detection to pipeline flow
   - Update merge strategy documentation

#### Critical Finding:
üî¥ **ISSUE #95 IS STILL OPEN** - Documentation is out of date with current implementation

---

### Issue #96: Implement "earliest non-empty wins" in production
**Status:** ‚úÖ Closed  
**Files Changed:** Multiple

#### What Was Implemented:
1. ‚úÖ "Earliest non-empty wins" in `data-merger.js` for cross-source merge
   - Changed from "Qualtrics always overwrites" to timestamp-based comparison
   - JotForm uses `created_at`, Qualtrics uses `recordedDate`
2. ‚úÖ Test version of `grade-detector.js` (UMD wrapper)
   - `TEMP/grade-detector-test.js`
   - Works in both Node.js and browser

#### Issues Found:
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Merge behavior changed from Qualtrics priority to timestamp-based
  - If JotForm recorded Oct 1 and Qualtrics Oct 3, JotForm now wins (previously Qualtrics would win)
  - This is the CORRECT behavior but represents a change from #92's documented strategy

---

### Issue #97: Add test version of grade-detector.js
**Status:** ‚úÖ Closed  
**Files Changed:** 8 files

#### What Was Implemented:
1. ‚úÖ Test infrastructure for grade-detector
   - `TEMP/grade-detector-test.js` - UMD wrapper
   - `TEMP/test-grade-detector-node.js` - 12 automated tests
   - `TEMP/test-grade-detector-compatibility.html` - Browser tests
2. ‚úÖ Documentation:
   - `TEMP/GRADE_DETECTOR_TEST_VERSION.md`
   - `TEMP/ISSUE_RESOLUTION_SUMMARY.md`
3. ‚úÖ Updated `USER_GUIDE_QUALTRICS_TGMD.md` to reflect consistent merge strategy

#### Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ 12/12 Node.js tests passing
- ‚úÖ 0 CodeQL alerts
- ‚úÖ Browser compatibility confirmed

## Critical Bugs Identified

### üî¥ BUG #1: Student Page Missing Essential Scripts

**Location:** `checking_system_4_student.html`

**Problem:**
The student page is missing critical scripts that are loaded on the home page:
- `qualtrics-api.js` - Qualtrics API wrapper
- `qualtrics-transformer.js` - Qualtrics data transformer
- `data-merger.js` - JotForm + Qualtrics merger
- `grade-detector.js` - Grade detection utility

**Impact:**
- **HIGH SEVERITY** - Student page cannot display merged Qualtrics data
- **HIGH SEVERITY** - Grade field will be undefined/missing
- **MEDIUM SEVERITY** - TGMD scoring may work if data comes pre-merged from cache, but new data won't merge properly

**Scripts Present on Home Page but Missing on Student Page:**
```html
<!-- Missing from checking_system_4_student.html -->
<script src="assets/js/qualtrics-api.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/qualtrics-transformer.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/data-merger.js"></script>
<script src="assets/js/grade-detector.js"></script>
```

**Why This Happened:**
- Student page uses different architecture (`checking-system-student-page.js`)
- Scripts were added to home page in #92 but student page was not updated
- Issue went unnoticed because student page works with cached data from home page

**Fix Required:**
Add the missing scripts to `checking_system_4_student.html` before the student page script loads.

---

### üî¥ BUG #2: Issue #95 Still Open - Documentation Out of Date

**Problem:**
PRD documentation has not been updated to reflect the major changes in #90-#97:
- Complete Qualtrics integration (all tasks, not just TGMD)
- Grade detection system
- TGMD matrix-radio scoring
- "Earliest non-empty wins" merge strategy
- Unique Core ID filtering

**Impact:**
- **MEDIUM SEVERITY** - New developers won't understand current system architecture
- **MEDIUM SEVERITY** - PRDs don't match actual implementation
- **LOW SEVERITY** - May cause confusion when planning future work

**Files Needing Updates:**
1. `PRDs/jotform_qualtrics_integration_prd.md`
2. `PRDs/checking_system_prd.md`
3. `PRDs/qualtrics_implementation_plan.md`
4. `PRDs/data-pipeline.md`

---

## Inconsistencies Found

### üü° INCONSISTENCY #1: Merge Strategy Documentation

**Issue:**
PR #92 description stated "Qualtrics data overwrites JotForm for matching fields (proper precedence)" but the code implemented "earliest non-empty wins".

**Timeline:**
1. PR #92: Documentation says "Qualtrics overwrites"
2. PR #94: Test pipeline corrected to "earliest non-empty wins"
3. PR #96-97: Production code updated to match test pipeline

**Current Status:**
‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - All code now uses "earliest non-empty wins" consistently
‚ùå **PR #92 description is historically inaccurate** but this is acceptable as it was corrected in later PRs

**No Action Required** - This is historical, current implementation is correct and consistent.

## Missing Features/Coverage

### üü° MISSING #1: Test Coverage for Student Page TGMD Rendering

**Issue:**
While TGMD scoring is tested in the TEMP pipeline, there's no automated test for the student page TGMD rendering (`renderTGMDResults` function).

**Impact:**
- **LOW SEVERITY** - Manual testing is required to verify TGMD display on student page
- Could lead to UI regressions going unnoticed

**Recommendation:**
Create a test HTML file in TEMP folder that loads student page rendering logic and validates TGMD display.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY**: Fix student page missing scripts
   - Add qualtrics-api.js, qualtrics-transformer.js, data-merger.js, grade-detector.js
   - Test student page with fresh data (not from cache)
   - Verify grade field displays correctly
   - Verify TGMD rendering works with new merge logic

2. **üî¥ MEDIUM PRIORITY**: Complete issue #95 - Update PRD documentation
   - Update at least 4 PRD files to reflect current implementation
   - Add grade detection to data schemas
   - Document TGMD scoring behavior
   - Update merge strategy documentation

3. **üü° LOW PRIORITY**: Add student page TGMD rendering tests
   - Create test HTML in TEMP for student page rendering
   - Validate TGMD grouped display
   - Verify Success/Fail labels

### Nice to Have:

4. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Add migration guide for existing data (if merge strategy change affects old data)
   - Create troubleshooting guide for grade detection edge cases
   - Document school year boundaries prominently

5. **Code Quality**:
   - Consider extracting merge strategy to its own module
   - Add JSDoc comments to new functions
   - Create unit tests for grade detection logic

## Testing Recommendations

Before marking issues #90-#97 as "fully complete":

1. ‚úÖ **Test grade detection** across all three school years (K1/K2/K3)
2. ‚úÖ **Test Qualtrics extraction** for non-TGMD tasks (ERV, SYM, TOM, etc.)
3. ‚úÖ **Test TGMD scoring** with trial aggregation
4. ‚úÖ **Test unique Core ID filtering** with students having multiple grade records
5. ‚ùå **Test student page** with fresh Qualtrics data (NOT from cache)
6. ‚ùå **Test merge conflict resolution** with different timestamps
7. ‚ùå **Test student page TGMD rendering** with grouped display

---

## Conclusion

The work done in issues #90-#97 represents a **major enhancement** to the 4Set system:
- ‚úÖ Complete Qualtrics integration (all tasks)
- ‚úÖ Grade detection system
- ‚úÖ TGMD matrix-radio scoring
- ‚úÖ Improved data merge strategy
- ‚úÖ Better user experience (unique filtering)

However, there are **2 critical issues** that need immediate attention:
1. üî¥ Student page missing essential scripts
2. üî¥ PRD documentation not updated (issue #95 still open)

**Overall Assessment:**
- **Functionality**: 95% complete (student page scripts missing)
- **Documentation**: 70% complete (PRDs need updating)
- **Testing**: 85% complete (student page needs testing)
- **Code Quality**: Excellent (consistent patterns, good separation of concerns)

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Fix student page script imports (immediate)
2. Test student page thoroughly (immediate)
3. Update PRD documentation (high priority)
4. Close issue #95 when documentation complete
