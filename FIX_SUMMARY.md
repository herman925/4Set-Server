# Fix Summary: Status Inconsistency Between Pages

**Issue:** Student status colors differ between class page and student detail page  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED  
**Date:** October 22, 2025

## Quick Summary

A critical bug in `jotform-cache.js` caused task completion status to be calculated differently on aggregate views (class, school, district, group) versus the individual student page.

**The Problem:** Tasks marked as "terminated" or "timed out" were incorrectly shown as complete (green) on class page even when the student had answered ZERO questions, while student page correctly showed them as not started (grey).

**The Fix:** Added `&& answered > 0` check to termination completion logic.

## The One-Line Fix

**File:** `assets/js/jotform-cache.js` Line 751-752

```diff
- (validation.terminated && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers) ||
- (validation.timedOut && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers);
+ (validation.terminated && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers && answered > 0) ||
+ (validation.timedOut && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers && answered > 0);
```

## Before vs After

### Before Fix
```
Student Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started" (0 answers)
Class Page:   🟢 Green "Complete"    (terminated flag set)
Result:       ❌ INCONSISTENT
```

### After Fix
```
Student Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started" (0 answers)
Class Page:   ⚪ Grey "Not started" (0 answers)
Result:       ✅ CONSISTENT
```

## Impact

- ✅ All pages now show identical status colors
- ✅ Eliminated user confusion
- ✅ Correctly represents actual completion
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## ⚠️ Action Required After Deployment

**Users MUST clear validation cache:**

1. Go to `checking_system_home.html`
2. Click green "System Ready" pill
3. Click "Delete Cache"
4. Re-sync by loading class/school pages

Without cache clear, old (incorrect) status will persist until natural expiration.
