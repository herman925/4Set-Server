# Implementation Summary: _TEXT Field Display Fix

**Issue:** #11 - N/A for the _TEXT answer detection is not what I imagined  
**Branch:** `copilot/fix-n-a-answer-detection`  
**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Review

---

## Problem Statement

User reported that the display of `_TEXT` fields (like `TOM_Q1_TEXT`) was confusing:

1. **Correct Answer Column:** Showed "N/A" - user expected a dash like other non-scored questions
2. **Result Column:** Status not clearly distinguished with appropriate visual styling
3. **Branch Information:** No indication of which TEC branch (Male/Female) was used

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Correct Answer Column - Changed to Dash
**File:** `assets/js/checking-system-student-page.js:860`

```javascript
// OLD
const correctAnswerDisplay = (isYNTask || question.isTextDisplay) ? 'N/A' : ...

// NEW
const correctAnswerDisplay = isYNTask ? 'N/A' : (question.isTextDisplay ? '—' : ...)
```

**Result:** _TEXT fields now display "—" instead of "N/A"

---

### 2. Result Column - Muted N/A Status
**File:** `assets/js/checking-system-student-page.js:837`

```javascript
// OLD
background: #f3f4f6; color: #6b7280; border-color: #d1d5db

// NEW
background: #f9fafb; color: #6b7280; border-color: #e5e7eb
```

**Result:** N/A status uses more muted gray colors, distinct from other statuses

---

### 3. Branch Information Display
**File:** `assets/js/checking-system-student-page.js:824-833`

```javascript
let branchInfo = '';
if (taskId.toLowerCase().includes('tec')) {
  // Check 'female' first since 'female' contains 'male' substring
  if (taskId.toLowerCase().includes('female')) {
    branchInfo = ' (Female Branch)';
  } else if (taskId.toLowerCase().includes('male')) {
    branchInfo = ' (Male Branch)';
  }
}
```

**Result:** TEC tasks show "(Male Branch)" or "(Female Branch)" in Result column

---

### 4. Bug Fix - Gender Branch Detection
**Issue:** String "female" contains substring "male"  
**Fix:** Check for "female" before "male" in if-else chain  
**Result:** Correct branch detection for both genders

---

## Testing

### Test Suite Created
**File:** `TEMP/test_text_field_result_column.py`

**Results:**
- ✅ Test 1: Correct Answer Column Display (4/4 tests passed)
- ✅ Test 2: Result Column N/A Status (1/1 tests passed)
- ✅ Test 3: Branch Information Display (3/3 tests passed)

**Overall:** 8/8 tests passed (100% success rate)
