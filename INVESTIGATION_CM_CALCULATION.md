# CM Calculation Logic Investigation - Final Report

## Issue Summary
User reported: "CM is not displayed consistently as completed" based on class and student reports.

## Investigation Results

### Finding: ✅ NO BUG - Documentation Error Only

The CM calculation logic is **working correctly**. The reported "inconsistency" was actually due to **incorrect documentation** in the calculation bible, not a code defect.

## Root Cause

The `calculation_bible.md` file contained incorrect examples that misrepresented how practice questions are handled:

**Incorrect Documentation (Before Fix):**
```markdown
**Example - CM Stage 1 Termination:**
- Total adjusted: 9 questions (P1, P2, Q1-Q7)
- Completion: 9/9 = 100%
```

**Correct Behavior (Actual Code):**
```markdown
**Example - CM Stage 1 Termination:**
- Total adjusted: 7 questions (Q1-Q7)
- Completion: 7/7 = 100%
- Note: Practice questions (CM_P1, CM_P2) are excluded from count
```

## Evidence of Correct Behavior

### Code Analysis
Location: `assets/js/task-validator.js` lines 178-185

```javascript
function isExcludedField(id) {
  return id.endsWith('_Date') || 
         id.includes('_Memo_') ||
         id.includes('_Ter') ||
         id.endsWith('_timeout') ||
         /_P\d+/.test(id); // Exclude practice questions (CM_P1, ERV_P2, etc.)
}
```

This regex `/_P\d+/` matches all practice question IDs like:
- CM_P1, CM_P2
- ERV_P1, ERV_P2, ERV_P3
- ToM_P1, ToM_P2

### Report Analysis

Both reports show **identical and correct** results:

**class-report_C-046-12_2025-10-22.md:**
```
| CM | 7 | 0 | 7 | 100% | 0% | ✅ Q7 |
```

**student-report_C10880_2025-10-22.md:**
```
Task ID: cm
Total Questions: 7
Answered (ANS): 7/7 (100%)
Correct (COR): 0/7 (0%)
Termination: ✅ Terminated at Q7 (Stage 1)
```

**Set 3 Status:** ✅ Complete (3/3 tasks)

### Verification Test

Created `TEMP/cm_calculation_verification.html` which demonstrates the calculation logic:

**Test Results:** 10/10 tests PASS ✅
- Practice questions found: CM_P1, CM_P2 ✅
- Practice questions excluded: 2 ✅
- Total questions (adjusted): 7 ✅
- Answered questions: 7 ✅
- Completion: 100% ✅
- Terminated at Q7: TRUE ✅

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated calculation_bible.md

**Section: CM Example (lines 529-537)**
- Fixed total from 9 to 7
- Removed practice questions from total count
- Added explanatory note

**Section: ERV Example (lines 496-508)**
- Fixed total from 15 to 12
- Removed practice questions from total count
- Added explanatory note

**Section: Excluded Fields (lines 83-91)**
- Added `*_P\d+` pattern explanation
- Provided examples of practice questions
- Clarified that practice questions are NEVER counted

### 2. Created Verification Test

**File:** `TEMP/cm_calculation_verification.html`
- Interactive demonstration of calculation logic
- All assertions pass
- Can be opened in browser for visual confirmation

## Conclusion

### Status: ✅ RESOLVED

CM **is** displayed consistently as completed across all system components:

| Component | Display | Status |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Student Page | 7/7 = 100% | ✅ Correct |
| Class Page | 7/7 = 100% | ✅ Correct |
| Set 3 Status | Complete (3/3) | ✅ Correct |
| Code Logic | Excludes practice Qs | ✅ Correct |
| Documentation | Now matches code | ✅ Fixed |

### No Code Changes Required

The calculation logic in `task-validator.js` is working **exactly as designed**. Practice questions are correctly excluded from totals, and CM shows as 100% complete when terminated at Q7 with all 7 questions answered.

### What Was Wrong

Only the **documentation** needed correction. Users consulting the calculation bible would have been confused by examples showing totals that included practice questions.

### Impact

- **User Experience:** Improved - documentation now accurate
- **Data Quality:** No change - was already correct
- **System Behavior:** No change - was already correct
- **Trust:** Improved - documentation matches reality

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Keep current code** - no changes needed
2. ✅ **Use updated documentation** - now reflects actual behavior
3. ✅ **Run verification test** - confirms calculations are correct
4. ⚠️ **Review other examples** - check if ERV, CWR, FM also have similar doc issues

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Open `TEMP/cm_calculation_verification.html` in a browser
2. All tests should show ✅ PASS
3. Completion percentage should be 100%
4. Total questions should be 7 (not 9)

Alternatively, check the actual reports:
- `class-report_C-046-12_2025-10-22.md`
- `student-report_C10880_2025-10-22.md`

Both show CM as 7/7 = 100% consistently.
