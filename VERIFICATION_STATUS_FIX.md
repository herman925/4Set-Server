# Verification Document: Status Inconsistency Fix

## Issue Description
Students showed different status colors on the class page versus their individual student detail page. This was caused by inconsistent task completion logic between the two pages.

## Root Cause
**File:** `assets/js/jotform-cache.js` Lines 749-751

The validation cache builder (used by class page and all aggregate views) was marking tasks as complete when they were terminated/timed out, even if they had ZERO answered questions. This contradicted the student page logic which requires `answered > 0` for a task to be considered complete.

### Bug Logic
```javascript
// BEFORE (BUGGY):
const isComplete = (answered === total && total > 0) || 
                   (validation.terminated && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers) ||  // ❌ No answered > 0 check
                   (validation.timedOut && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers);       // ❌ No answered > 0 check
```

### Fix Applied
```javascript
// AFTER (FIXED):
const isComplete = (answered === total && total > 0) || 
                   (validation.terminated && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers && answered > 0) ||
                   (validation.timedOut && !validation.hasPostTerminationAnswers && answered > 0);
```

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Task terminated with 0 answers
**Before Fix:**
- Student Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started"
- Class Page: 🟢 Green "Complete" ❌ INCONSISTENT

**After Fix:**
- Student Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started"
- Class Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started" ✅ CONSISTENT

### Scenario 2: Task terminated with answers
**Before Fix:**
- Student Page: 🟢 Green "Complete"
- Class Page: 🟢 Green "Complete" ✅ CONSISTENT

**After Fix:**
- Student Page: 🟢 Green "Complete"
- Class Page: 🟢 Green "Complete" ✅ CONSISTENT

### Scenario 3: Task timed out with 0 answers
**Before Fix:**
- Student Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started"
- Class Page: 🟢 Green "Complete" ❌ INCONSISTENT

**After Fix:**
- Student Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started"
- Class Page: ⚪ Grey "Not started" ✅ CONSISTENT

### Scenario 4: Task 100% complete (no termination)
**Before Fix:**
- Student Page: 🟢 Green "Complete"
- Class Page: 🟢 Green "Complete" ✅ CONSISTENT

**After Fix:**
- Student Page: 🟢 Green "Complete"
- Class Page: 🟢 Green "Complete" ✅ CONSISTENT

### Scenario 5: Task 50% complete
**Before Fix:**
- Student Page: 🔴 Red "Incomplete"
- Class Page: 🔴 Red "Incomplete" ✅ CONSISTENT

**After Fix:**
- Student Page: 🔴 Red "Incomplete"
- Class Page: 🔴 Red "Incomplete" ✅ CONSISTENT

## Verification Steps

### Manual Testing Required
1. **Navigate to a class page** with students who have:
   - Tasks with termination flags but 0 answers
   - Tasks with termination flags and some answers
   - Tasks with 100% completion
   - Tasks with partial completion

2. **Compare status circles** between:
   - Class page "By Task" view (individual task columns)
   - Class page "By Set" view (set-level aggregation)
   - Student detail page (individual task status circles)

3. **Expected Results** after fix:
   - All three views should show IDENTICAL colors for the same student's tasks
   - Grey circle = not started (0 answers)
   - Red circle = incomplete (some answers, not finished)
   - Yellow circle = post-termination data detected
   - Green circle = complete (100% answered OR properly terminated with answers)

### Cache Invalidation
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** After deploying this fix, users MUST clear their validation cache to see the corrected status:

1. Go to `checking_system_home.html`
2. Click the green "System Ready" status pill
3. Click "Delete Cache" button
4. Re-sync cache by loading data again

The validation cache stores pre-calculated task completion status. Without clearing it, users will continue to see the old (buggy) status values until the cache expires naturally.

## Impact Assessment

| Category | Before Fix | After Fix |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Consistency** | ❌ Inconsistent between pages | ✅ Fully consistent |
| **User Confusion** | High (contradictory colors) | None (aligned logic) |
| **Data Accuracy** | Critical issue (misrepresentation) | Accurate (correct logic) |
| **Cache Dependency** | N/A | ⚠️ Requires cache clear |
